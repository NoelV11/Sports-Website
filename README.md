# Sports Website
I have created a sports website,which can be taken up by beginners as projects while studying Web Programming.This website primarily makes use of CSS Styling, JavaScript, DHTML and PHP/SQL Database Features
The Website covers 4 sports.A common theme has been applied to design webpages relating to the sport.
A feedback form has been created,which uses JavaScript and PHP/MySQL.The feedback given by the user is stored in the backend daatabase

Make sure to have the XAMPP Server up and ready,since it is crucial to ensure the database's functionality,using PHPMyAdmin tool
